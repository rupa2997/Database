Using the UNION clause.
1) Create a union of two queries that shows the names, cities, and ratings of all
customers. Those with rating of 200 or greater will also have the words “High
Rating”, while the others will have the words “Low Rating”.
---select Cname, City, Rating,'High Rating' from customers where rating >=200 Union (select Cname, City, Rating ,'Low Rating' from customers where rating<200);

2) Write a command that produces the name and number of each salesperson and
each customer with more than one current order. Put the results in alphabetical
order.
-- select customers.snum, salespeople.sname,customers.cnum,customers.cname from salespeople,customers where customers.snum=salespeople.snum and salespeople.snum in (select snum from customers group by snum having count(snum) > 1) order by 2,4;

----Select 'Customer Number ' || cnum "Code ",count(*)
from orders
group by cnum
having count(*) > 1
UNION
select 'Salesperson Number '||snum,count(*)
from orders
group by snum
having count(*) > 1;
3) Form a union of three queries. Have the first select the snums of all salespeople in
San Jose; the second, the cnums of all customers in San Jose; and the third the
onums of all orders on October 3. Retain duplicates between the last two queries
but eliminate any redundancies between either of them and the first.
(Note: in the sample tables as given, there would be no such redundancy. This is
besides the point.)
---SELECT snum
FROM salespeople
WHERE city='san jose'
UNION
SELECT DISTINCT Cnum
FROM customers
WHERE  city="san jose" and Cnum IN
    (SELECT Cnum
     FROM orders
     WHERE odate LIKE '03-OCT-%');
